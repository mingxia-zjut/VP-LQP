## README

This is a preliminary release of the dataset for our paper "Toward Ubiquitous Vision-Augmented Intelligent Communications: A Generalized Loosely Coupled Approach". The data for training and testing the **Network Deployment Learning (NDL)** model are in `datasets/NDL`. and the data for training and testing the **Blockage Scene Simulation (BSS)** model are in `datasets/BSS`. Currently, the visual modality data have been preprocessed to probide only the trace of pedestrian obstacles, allowing result reproducing while protecting the pedestrian's privacy. A more comprehensive version, including documentation, code, etc., will be available soon.


<!-- ## Datasets Introduction

### Overview
Aiming at realizing ubiquitous vision-augmented communications in various network deployments, our dataset adopts
different deployment configurations for model training and testing.

Specifically, the dataset is organized into four quadrants as fig shown below.
